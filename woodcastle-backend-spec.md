# Woodcastle — Backend Specification (Phase 1)

This document specifies the backend for **Woodcastle**, a wood furniture shop's website, pairing with a Next.js frontend (public website) and a Next.js/React admin panel. It's written so you can hand it directly to an AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) to scaffold the backend, or follow it step by step yourself.

---

## 1. Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js (v20 LTS) | Standard, huge ecosystem |
| Framework | Express.js | Simple, well-documented, easy for a first backend |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Relational data (products ↔ categories ↔ enquiries) fits well |
| ORM | Prisma | Auto-generates types, migrations, and a friendly query API |
| Auth (admin) | JWT + username/password + optional TOTP (`otplib` + `qrcode` npm packages) | Username/password login, with Google Authenticator-based 2FA as a second factor |
| File storage | Cloudinary or Firebase Storage | Product images, blog images, offer banners |
| Cloudinary SDK | `cloudinary` npm package | Server-side signature generation only — see section 5b; the SDK never handles the actual file upload |
| Spreadsheet parsing | `xlsx` (SheetJS) npm package | Parses uploaded .xlsx files for bulk product/category import |
| WhatsApp | `wa.me` click-to-chat link (no API/business verification needed) | Enquiry opens WhatsApp with a prefilled message; customer taps send themselves — zero cost, zero approval wait |
| Hosting | Render / Railway / a VPS | Any Node-friendly host |

## 4. API Endpoints

### Public (consumed by the Next.js website)

```
GET    /api/categories
GET    /api/categories/:slug/products
```
`GET /api/categories` returns a nested tree — top-level categories (`parentId: null`) each with a `children` array of their subcategories. Products are always assigned to a **subcategory** (the leaf level), not a top-level category, matching how Woodcastle's actual catalog (Sofa & Sofa Sets → 3 Seater Sofa, etc.) is structured.

```
GET    /api/products               # accepts ?search= (matches product name/description) and
                                     # ?category= (subcategory slug) for the homepage search + filter feature,
                                     # plus existing ?page=/?limit= pagination
GET    /api/products/:slug

GET    /api/pages/:key            # about, terms, contact content
GET    /api/blog
GET    /api/blog/:slug

GET    /api/offers                # active offers only (isActive + within startsAt/endsAt window)

GET    /api/reviews               # active reviews only (isActive: true); accepts optional
                                    # ?productId= to get reviews for one specific product,
                                    # omit it to get general/site-wide testimonials

GET    /api/google-reviews        # server-side proxy to Google Places API — see section 5d.
                                    # Returns { rating, totalReviews, reviews: [...] } (up to 5),
                                    # cached, never calls Google directly from the browser

POST   /api/enquiries              # creates/updates User by phone (no verification step), creates Enquiry,
                                     # and returns a ready-to-use wa.me click-to-chat link
                                     # body: { name, phone, message, productId } -> response: { enquiry, whatsappLink }
```

All product/category/blog GET responses include `metaTitle` and `metaDescription` so the Next.js frontend can populate `<head>` tags without a second request.

**Pagination:** `/api/products`, `/api/categories/:slug/products`, and `/api/blog` accept optional `?page=` and `?limit=` query params (default `limit=12`), returning `{ items, page, totalPages, totalCount }`. This supports the frontend's "Load More" button pattern — no new feature, just pagination on endpoints that already existed in this spec.

### Admin Auth (username/password + optional Google Authenticator 2FA)

```
POST   /api/admin/login              # body: { username, password } -> if totpEnabled=false, returns JWT directly
                                       # if totpEnabled=true, returns { requiresTotp: true, tempToken } instead
POST   /api/admin/login/verify-totp  # body: { tempToken, code } -> verifies 6-digit code, returns JWT

POST   /api/admin/2fa/setup          # (JWT-protected) generates a TOTP secret + QR code image for the admin to scan
POST   /api/admin/2fa/enable         # body: { code } -> confirms the first code from the app, sets totpEnabled = true
POST   /api/admin/2fa/disable        # body: { password } -> turns 2FA back off
```

### Admin (protected by adminAuth middleware, requires completed login above)

```
GET    /api/admin/enquiries        # accepts ?search= (matches name/phone/product name) and ?status=
PATCH  /api/admin/enquiries/:id    # update status

POST   /api/admin/upload/signature # generates a Cloudinary signed-upload signature (see section 5b) —
                                     # NOT a file upload endpoint itself; the actual file goes straight
                                     # from the browser to Cloudinary, never through this backend

GET    /api/admin/products         # returns ALL products regardless of isActive (unlike the public
                                     # GET /api/products, which only shows active ones) — accepts
                                     # ?search= (name/description) and ?categoryId= to filter

GET    /api/admin/products/check-duplicate-name   # accepts ?name=&categoryId= (subcategory id) -
                                     # see section 5a3 for the full behavior and response shape

POST   /api/admin/products         # body must include categoryId set to a SUBCATEGORY's id (never a
                                     # top-level category's id) — reject with a clear error if the
                                     # given categoryId belongs to a category that has children
                                     # (i.e. it's a main category, not a leaf)
PATCH  /api/admin/products/:id
DELETE /api/admin/products/:id

GET    /api/admin/categories       # returns the full category tree regardless of any active/inactive
                                     # concept — accepts ?search= (matches name at either level)
POST   /api/admin/categories       # body accepts parentId (nullable) — omit or send null for a
                                     # top-level category, or a valid top-level category's id to
                                     # create a subcategory under it
PATCH  /api/admin/categories/:id
DELETE /api/admin/categories/:id   # should reject with a clear error if the category still has
                                     # products or child subcategories attached, rather than
                                     # silently orphaning them — reassign or remove those first

GET    /api/admin/blog             # returns ALL posts including unpublished drafts (unlike the public
                                     # GET /api/blog, which only shows published ones) — accepts
                                     # ?search= (title) and ?published= filter
POST   /api/admin/blog
PATCH  /api/admin/blog/:id
DELETE /api/admin/blog/:id

GET    /api/admin/offers           # returns ALL offers regardless of active date window (unlike the
                                     # public GET /api/offers) — accepts ?search= (title) and ?isActive=
POST   /api/admin/offers
PATCH  /api/admin/offers/:id
DELETE /api/admin/offers/:id

POST   /api/admin/import/preview   # multipart file upload (.xlsx) -> parses file, validates rows,
                                     # returns { categories: [...], products: [...], errors: [...] }
                                     # WITHOUT writing to the database yet
POST   /api/admin/import/confirm    # body: { importId } -> commits the previously-previewed rows
                                     # (creates new categories/products, updates existing ones matched by slug)
GET    /api/admin/import/history    # list of past BulkImportLog entries

GET    /api/admin/pages            # list all StaticPage entries (about/terms/contact) for the admin's
                                     # site content list screen
GET    /api/admin/pages/:key       # single page's current title/content - the edit form MUST call
                                     # this on load to pre-fill the form; it is not optional, and
                                     # is a different endpoint from the list above
PATCH  /api/admin/pages/:key       # edit about/terms/contact content

GET    /api/admin/reviews          # returns ALL reviews regardless of isActive — accepts ?search=

POST   /api/admin/reviews          # body: { customerName, rating, reviewText, customerPhoto?, productId? }
PATCH  /api/admin/reviews/:id
DELETE /api/admin/reviews/:id
```

## 5. Enquiry → WhatsApp Flow (Phase 1 core logic)

No OTP verification service is used in Phase 1 — enquiries are captured directly, and WhatsApp is handled via a free `wa.me` click-to-chat link rather than the paid/approval-gated Business API.

1. **User submits enquiry form** on a product page (`POST /api/enquiries`, body: `{ name, phone, message, productId }`).
2. Backend:
   - Finds or creates a `User` record by phone number (no verification step — the record is created directly from the submitted name/phone).
   - Creates the `Enquiry` record linked to that user and product.
   - Builds a `wa.me` link via `whatsappLink.js`: `https://wa.me/<WHATSAPP_ADMIN_NUMBER>?text=<url-encoded message>`, where the message includes the customer's name, phone, product name, and their enquiry text — so the admin sees full context the moment they open WhatsApp.
3. **Response to frontend**: `{ enquiry, whatsappLink }`.
4. Frontend immediately opens `whatsappLink` (e.g. `window.open(whatsappLink, '_blank')`) — this opens WhatsApp (web or app) with the message pre-filled in a chat with the admin's number. The **customer taps send themselves** — this is the one manual step required by the free, zero-approval approach, versus a paid Business API that could send it fully automatically.
5. The enquiry is already saved and visible in the admin's `/admin/enquiries` inbox regardless of whether the customer actually taps send on WhatsApp — the backend doesn't depend on that step succeeding.

**Why click-to-chat instead of the Business API:** the Meta/Twilio WhatsApp Business APIs require business verification and pre-approved message templates before they can message a new number — real cost and 1-2 weeks of lead time. `wa.me` links work instantly, for free, with no approval process, at the cost of requiring the customer to tap "send" themselves. If the client wants fully automated server-side sending later, that's a Phase 2+ upgrade path, not something this spec assumes.

---

## 5a. Admin Login with Google Authenticator (2FA) Flow

1. **First-time setup:** admin logs in with username/password, then calls `POST /api/admin/2fa/setup`. Backend generates a TOTP secret (via `otplib`), stores it unconfirmed, and returns a QR code (via `qrcode`) for the admin to scan in the Google Authenticator app.
2. Admin enters the 6-digit code Google Authenticator shows → `POST /api/admin/2fa/enable` confirms it and flips `totpEnabled = true`.
3. **Every login after that:** `POST /api/admin/login` checks username/password first. If `totpEnabled` is true, it does *not* return a JWT yet — it returns a short-lived `tempToken` and a flag telling the frontend to show a "enter your 6-digit code" screen.
4. Admin enters the current code from Google Authenticator → `POST /api/admin/login/verify-totp` checks it against the stored secret and, if valid, returns the real JWT.
5. 2FA can be turned off from admin settings (`POST /api/admin/2fa/disable`) by re-entering the password — useful if the admin loses their device, though for a production client you'd typically want a manual recovery process too.

This gives you exactly what was asked for: username + password as the first factor, Google Authenticator as an optional second factor, without forcing 2FA on day one if the client just wants to launch quickly.

## 5a2. Rich Text Product Descriptions (Bold, Italic, Color, Lists, Tables)

Product descriptions support formatting (bold, italic, text color, bullet/numbered lists, tables) — same rich text editor already used for blog posts (Tiptap), reused here rather than building a separate one.

- `Product.description` stores the editor's **HTML output** directly, same as `BlogPost.content` already does
- **Sanitize on the way out, not just the way in:** since this HTML renders directly on public product pages, run it through a sanitizer (e.g. `sanitize-html` or `DOMPurify` server-side, or `rehype-sanitize` if rendering via a markdown/HTML pipeline) before it's ever sent to the public site — restrict to the tags Tiptap actually produces (`b`/`strong`, `i`/`em`, `span` with color styles, `ul`/`ol`/`li`, `table`/`tr`/`td`/`th`) and strip anything else. This matters because the admin panel is the only thing writing this field, but sanitizing on output is still the safer habit — it protects against any future second admin account, a compromised login, or a bug in the editor itself producing unexpected markup
- No schema change beyond what's already there — `description` was always a `String`, it's just storing richer content now

---

## 5a3. Duplicate Product Name Detection (Auto-Generated Product Code)

**Why this matters:** `Product.slug` is unique across the *entire* catalog, not just within a category. Two products both named "Dining Chair" in the same subcategory would generate the same slug and collide — this feature catches that at the moment of typing, rather than as a confusing save error later.

**No schema change needed** — the generated code gets appended directly into the `name` field itself (and the `slug` derived from that new name), not stored as a separate column. This keeps the fix contained to name/slug generation rather than adding a new concept to the data model.

**The bug to specifically avoid — always compare and build from the base name, never from a previously-suggested name.** A real implementation of this produced `"Dining Chair DC-02 DC-2"` on the third product, because it took whatever the admin had already typed (which by then included a previous suggestion) and appended a new code onto *that*, instead of stripping any existing code pattern first and rebuilding cleanly from the true base name. The algorithm must do this on every check, not just the first one:

1. **Strip any existing product-code suffix from the input name first**, using a fixed pattern like `/\s+[A-Z]{2,4}-\d{2,}$/` (matches things like `" DC-02"` at the end of a string) — whatever remains after stripping is the **base name**. If the admin typed "Dining Chair" fresh, the base name is just "Dining Chair." If the admin is re-checking a name that already got suggested once ("Dining Chair DC-02") and it still somehow gets re-submitted, the base name after stripping is still "Dining Chair" — never "Dining Chair DC-02."
2. As the admin types (and has a subcategory selected), the frontend calls `GET /api/admin/products/check-duplicate-name?name=<name>&categoryId=<subcategoryId>` (debounced, same pattern as the search suggestions — don't fire on every keystroke). Send the raw typed value; stripping happens server-side per step 1.
3. Backend counts existing products whose name, **after the same stripping rule is applied to them too**, case-insensitively equals the base name — **within that exact subcategory only** (a "Dining Chair" in a different subcategory doesn't count).
4. Generate the code fresh from the base name and the count: subcategory initials (e.g. "Dining Chair" → `DC`) plus `existingCount + 1`, zero-padded to 2 digits — **always 2 digits, `02` through `09`, then `10`, `11`, etc. — never a mix like `2` in one response and `02` in another.** `suggestedName` is always `baseName + " " + code`, built fresh — never the old name with something else appended onto it.
   ```json
   {
     "isDuplicate": true,
     "existingCount": 2,
     "suggestedCode": "DC-03",
     "suggestedName": "Dining Chair DC-03",
     "suggestedSlug": "dining-chair-dc-03"
   }
   ```
   (This example shows the *third* "Dining Chair" — two already exist, so `existingCount: 2` and the new one is `DC-03`.) If no match after stripping, `isDuplicate: false` and the rest of the fields are omitted.
5. **Safety net at save time:** even if the frontend check is somehow skipped or stale, `POST /api/admin/products` should still reject a request whose generated slug would collide with an existing one, returning a clear error — the live-check is a convenience, not the only line of defense.

See section 8 of the frontend spec ("Duplicate product name detection") for the confirmation dialog and field-update behavior this powers.

## 5b. Image Upload Flow (Cloudinary Signed Upload)

This was previously described only narratively ("direct-to-Cloudinary signed upload") without an actual API contract — that's what caused PROD-06 and MISC-01 to fail in testing, since there was nothing concrete to implement against. Here's the exact contract:

**The file itself never touches this backend.** This backend's only job is to hand the frontend a short-lived, signed permission slip to upload directly to Cloudinary. This keeps large image uploads off your Render instance entirely.

1. **Frontend requests a signature** before uploading: `POST /api/admin/upload/signature` (admin JWT required), optional body `{ folder: "products" }` (or `"categories"`, `"offers"`, `"blog"`, `"reviews"`).
2. **Backend generates the signature** server-side using the Cloudinary API secret (via the `cloudinary` npm SDK's `utils.api_sign_request`), based on a timestamp, the target folder, **and a fixed `format: "webp"` parameter** — this is what converts every upload to WebP regardless of what the admin's phone/camera produced (JPEG, PNG, HEIC, etc.), so the signature itself must include `format` since it's part of what gets signed. Response:
   ```json
   {
     "signature": "a1b2c3...",
     "timestamp": 1755000000,
     "apiKey": "your_cloudinary_api_key",
     "cloudName": "your_cloud_name",
     "folder": "products",
     "format": "webp"
   }
   ```
3. **Frontend uploads directly to Cloudinary** using these values — a plain multipart `POST` from the browser to `https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/<cloudName>/image/upload`, with the file plus `signature`, `timestamp`, `api_key`, `folder`, **and `format`** as form fields — all four non-file fields must exactly match what was signed, or Cloudinary rejects the upload as tampered. This request goes straight to Cloudinary's servers, not this backend.
4. **Cloudinary converts the file to WebP during the upload itself** and responds directly to the frontend with the uploaded image's `secure_url` — already ending in `.webp`, already the smaller file, no separate conversion step or job needed anywhere.
5. **Frontend saves that URL** as part of the normal product/category/offer create-or-update call (e.g. `POST /api/admin/products` with `images: ["https://res.cloudinary.com/.../image.webp"]`) — same as if the URL had been typed in manually.

**Why convert at upload instead of at delivery:** Cloudinary can also serve any stored image as WebP on the fly via a `f_auto` URL parameter without changing what's stored — that's actually Cloudinary's own recommended default, since `f_auto` picks the best format per visitor's browser (sometimes AVIF, which beats WebP). Converting at upload time instead, as specified here, is a deliberate simplification: every stored file is WebP, every URL in the database is already final, and there's no per-image transformation logic to maintain anywhere else in the app. The trade-off is giving up that occasional extra saving from AVIF — reasonable for a catalog this size, and easy to revisit later if it ever matters.

This is why `POST /api/admin/upload` returning a 404 in testing was expected once you know the real contract — that route was never meant to accept the file. The only backend route needed is the signature endpoint above.

## 5c. Bulk Product/Category Import (Excel Upload) Flow

This is the feature that lets you upload 10+ products at once instead of adding them one by one in the admin UI, using the `woodcastle-product-upload-template.xlsx` template.

**Confirmed file format** (sheet order matters — the importer reads by position):

1. **Categories** sheet: `Category Name`, `Slug`, `Parent Category Name`, `Image URL`, `Meta Title`, `Meta Description`
2. **Products** sheet: `Product Name`, `Category Name`, `Description`, `Image URL`, `Price`, `Is Active`, `Slug`, `Meta Title`, `Meta Description`
3. Any further sheets (e.g. an Instructions tab) — ignored by the parser as long as they come after Categories and Products

**Multiple product images:** the single `Image URL` column accepts multiple URLs separated by a pipe character (`|`), e.g. `https://.../img1.jpg|https://.../img2.jpg` — the first URL is treated as the primary listing image, the rest populate the gallery. Split on `|` and trim whitespace when parsing.

1. **Admin uploads the .xlsx file** via `POST /api/admin/import/preview` (multipart form upload).
2. Backend parses it with the `xlsx` (SheetJS) library, reading the **Categories** sheet first, then the **Products** sheet.
3. **Validation, per row — every column is required** (per the client's requirement, no optional fields in bulk import, unlike the single-item admin forms which still allow some fields to stay blank):
   - **Categories sheet:** `Category Name`, `Slug`, `Parent Category Name` (top-level categories use a fixed placeholder value like `"—"` or `"NONE"` here instead of leaving it blank, since the field itself is now required), `Image URL`, `Meta Title`, `Meta Description` — all must be filled
   - **Products sheet:** `Product Name`, `Category Name`, `Description`, `Image URL`, `Price`, `Is Active`, `Slug`, `Meta Title`, `Meta Description` — all must be filled
   - Every product's `Category Name` matches a **subcategory** either already in the database or present in this same sheet's Categories tab (case-insensitive match) — products are never assigned directly to a top-level category
   - Every subcategory row's `Parent Category Name` matches a top-level category, either already in the database or elsewhere in the same sheet
   - `Price` is numeric
   - `Is Active` parses to a boolean (`TRUE`/`FALSE`, case-insensitive)
   - Duplicate `slug` values within the sheet itself are flagged
   - A row with any blank required cell is rejected with a specific "X is required" error naming the exact column, same as the errors you saw in the preview screenshot earlier
4. Backend returns a **preview** (not yet saved): counts of rows to be created vs. updated (matched by slug against existing records), plus a list of row-level errors with row number, field, and message — this is what the admin panel shows before anything goes live.
5. Admin reviews the preview in the UI, fixes the sheet and re-uploads if there are errors, or clicks "Confirm Import."
6. `POST /api/admin/import/confirm` commits the rows: creates new categories/products, or **updates existing ones** if the slug already matches a record in the database (so re-uploading a corrected sheet is safe — it won't create duplicates).
7. A `BulkImportLog` record is saved for every import, so there's an audit trail of what was uploaded and when, and any admin can check `GET /api/admin/import/history` to see past imports and their error counts.

**Note on Google Sheets vs. .xlsx:** this spec assumes the admin uploads a `.xlsx` file (exported from Excel or from Google Sheets via File → Download). Direct live-sync from a Google Sheet URL (via the Google Sheets API) is a heavier integration — OAuth setup, service account permissions — and isn't included in Phase 1. If that's genuinely wanted over a manual upload-and-confirm flow, it's worth scoping as a separate small addition rather than assuming it's included here.

## 5d. Google Reviews Integration (Read-Only Display)

This is a companion to the admin-entered `Review` model above, not a replacement for it — it pulls Woodcastle's real Google Business reviews into a small "As Seen on Google" widget, separate from the fully-controlled admin-curated reviews section.

**The real constraint:** Google's official Places API caps out at 5 reviews per business, chosen by Google's own relevance algorithm — there's no way to request more, paginate, or pick which ones show. This has been a standing limitation for years and isn't something this integration can work around. If genuinely *all* Google reviews are needed, that requires the separate Google Business Profile API, which needs Google's business-owner approval process (written/video application, weeks of lead time) — treat that as a distinct, optional future addition, not part of this spec.

**How it works:**
1. One-time setup: find Woodcastle's Google **Place ID** (via Google's Place ID Finder tool, using the business's Maps listing) and add it to the backend's environment variables.
2. `GET /api/google-reviews` calls Google's Places API **server-side** (Place Details request, requesting the `rating`, `userRatingCount`, and `reviews` fields) using `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` — this key stays on the backend and is never sent to the browser.
3. **Cache the result** (e.g. revalidate every 24 hours, not on every page load) — this respects Google's usage policies around not hammering the API, and keeps this well within the free monthly credit at Woodcastle's traffic scale.
4. Response shape: `{ rating: 4.8, totalReviews: 142, reviews: [{ authorName, rating, text, relativeTimeDescription, profilePhotoUrl }, ...up to 5] }`.
5. **Display requirements (Google's terms, not optional):** show the Google "G" logo/attribution near the widget, and link back to the actual Google Maps listing — don't present the reviews as if they're independently verified by Woodcastle.

## 7. Build Order (recommended sequence)

1. Set up Express app skeleton + Prisma + PostgreSQL connection
2. Admin auth: username/password login + JWT-protected routes (build this early — everything else in the admin panel needs it)
3. Categories + Products CRUD (admin) and read endpoints (public), including `metaTitle`/`metaDescription` fields
4. Static pages (About/Terms/Contact) CRUD + read endpoints, including the admin list endpoint (`GET /api/admin/pages`) so there's an actual admin screen to edit them from
5. Blog CRUD + read endpoints
6. Offers CRUD + public read endpoint
7. Reviews CRUD + public read endpoint (reuses the same image upload flow from section 5b for `customerPhoto`)
8. Admin 2FA (TOTP setup/enable/disable/verify) — add once basic admin login works
9. Image upload signature endpoint (`POST /api/admin/upload/signature`) — needed before the admin forms' image uploads can work at all; wire this up before building out the product/category/offer/review forms on the frontend
10. Bulk import (preview + confirm endpoints, using the xlsx template) — build once product/category CRUD is solid, since import reuses the same validation rules
11. Enquiry creation endpoint, including the `whatsappLink.js` builder (this is just string formatting, no external API — much simpler than the old OTP+WhatsApp-API flow, can be built and tested in one pass)
12. Connect admin panel (Next.js) to all admin endpoints

Building in this order means you have a working, testable backend at every step. Removing the OTP/WhatsApp-API dependency also removes what used to be the one external-approval bottleneck in this build — nothing in Phase 1 now depends on a third party approving anything.

## 8. What This Spec Deliberately Leaves Open

- Payment/billing (Phase 2)
- Furniture customisation / configurable product options (Phase 2)
- OTP/phone verification for enquiries — deliberately not used in Phase 1 per the client's decision; could be added later if fake/spam enquiries become a real problem
- True server-side WhatsApp auto-send (Business API) — deliberately not used in Phase 1; the `wa.me` click-to-chat link requires the customer to tap send themselves, which is the accepted trade-off for avoiding API cost and business verification
- Rate limiting / spam protection on the enquiry form (recommended even for Phase 1, and more relevant now that there's no OTP step filtering submissions — add `express-rate-limit` on `/api/enquiries`)
- Admin 2FA recovery process if a device is lost (needs a manual/support-based recovery path before real client handoff)
- **Retroactive conversion of already-uploaded images:** the WebP conversion in section 5b only applies going forward — any image uploaded before this was added stays in its original format (JPEG/PNG) unless someone re-uploads it. A one-time cleanup script (loop through existing Cloudinary assets, request a WebP-converted copy, update the stored URLs) is a separate small task if converting the existing catalog's images matters, not something this spec assumes happens automatically
